let amount = 12
console.log(amount) 
//var is old way of declaring variables
//let is new way of declaring variables
//const is used for constant variables  which cannot be changed later
//const amount = 12
//amount = 13
//console.log(amount) //error
//javascript is dynamically typed language - no need to specify type of variable
